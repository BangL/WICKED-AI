WAI-ZOMBIELAND 1.9.3
==============

As i really liked the WAI missions and support for them in the latest epoch patches has gone, i decided to dust off the old files and start making these properly 1.0.5+ compatible. It started with a few minor bugfixes and some custom loadout and decided to share for anyone interested. Now planning on taking this to the next level for everyone to enjoy. 

Todo
- Change system to include both bandit and hero missions
- Add more missions
- Fix C130 mission
- Add posibility of multiple missions running at the same time (A redo of markers.sqf, missions.sqf and mission timer should suffice)
- Find a creative way to deal with the vodnik 'abusers' without making making the diffuclty higher for the non-abusers.
